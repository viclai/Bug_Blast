## Development

The code for this project is adopted from skeleton code provided by
<a href="http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/">Carey Nachenberg</a> and
<a href="http://www.computomata.com/consultants/smallberg">David Smallberg</a>.
The skeleton code provides functionality for graphics and audio.

Objected-oriented programming in C++ is used to create the complete gameplay
of *Bug Blast*. Class composition and inheritance is used to create the objects
and characters in the game.
