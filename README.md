# Development

The code for this project is adopted from skeleton code provided by <a href="http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Carey Nachenberg</a> and <a href="http://www.computomata.com/consultants/smallberg" target="_blank">David Smallberg</a>. The skeleton code provides functionality for graphics and Windows compatability. 

Objected-oriented programming in C++ is used to create the complete gameplay of Bug Blast. Class composition and inheritance is used to create the objects and characters in the game.
